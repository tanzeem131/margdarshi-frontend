## NFT Marketplace Frontend
This project is a modern, responsive frontend for a futuristic NFT marketplace, featuring a dynamic hero page and a collection/leaderboard view.

Technical Approach
This application was built with a focus on performance, developer experience, and type safety.

Next.js: I chose Next.js over standard React for its performance features, like server-side rendering and file-based routing, which ensure faster page loads and better SEO.

TypeScript: I used TypeScript to add static typing, improving code quality and maintainability by catching potential errors during development.

Tailwind CSS: For styling, I implemented Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid and efficient UI development directly within the HTML.

How to Use
Homepage: When you first land on the site, you will see the main hero section.

Navigate to the Marketplace: Simply click the "Start Game" button.

Explore: You will be redirected to the /game page, where you can see the NFT marketplace and the leaderboard.
